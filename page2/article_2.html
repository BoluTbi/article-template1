                    <p class = 'ac-para1'>In recent times, both the general pharmaceutical council(GPhC)  and the Company Chemists’ Association(CCA) have stressed the need for pharmacy workers after picking up on a marked increase in the amount of pharmacies facing the possibility of closures  due to the shortage of pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in the workforce coupled with rapidly escalating employment costs. The shortage is said to have been “Exacerbated by Brexit and COVID-19” according to follow up reports from the CCA.

                    </p>
                    <p>CCA CEO Malcolm Harrison said: “The pressures facing the pharmacist workforce, and the creation of new positions in the NHS, when insufficient additional pharmacists are being trained, are a significant threat to healthcare in England. Fundamentally, without action patient access to medicines is likely to suffer.”  Prior to the publication of the CCA’s statement, Jeremy Meader – managing director of Numark – told C+D : “What we must avoid is sectors competing with each other for pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who are in short supply, as that is simply...a zero-sum game adding nothing to improving patient care” In attempts to address this issue,  the NHS plan to recruit more than 7,000 pharmacists by 2024 whilst the English government  pledged to invest up to £15.9 million over the next four years into a programme to “enhance” pharmacists' and pharmacy technicians’ skill. The Health Education England (HEE) director of national transformational programmes said in a statement “New funded programmes will foster a range of skills and experiences to help pharmacists and pharmacy technicians thrive in multidisciplinary healthcare teams, and meet the demand for clinical care skills, prevention of ill-health and optimal outcomes from medicines in all NHS settings and at home”.
 
                    </p>
                    <p>Efforts are being made nationwide to incentivize a career path in the pharmaceutical industry from increased funding for education as well as to raise awareness about these shortages. It has become glaringly obvious more than ever that pharmacy workers play an instrumental role in the upkeep of their surrounding communities' health.
