                    <p class = 'ac-para1'>Last September, the government set out plans to overhaul the current social care modus operandi in attempts to enrich and personalise the care experience for those in need. The bill outlines a 10-year plan to reform competitive and procurement based social care to allow the NHS and its partners the flexibility to deliver joined-up care to the increasing number of people who rely on multiple services. The strategy comprises a £5.4bn investment in the industry over the next 3 years including £500 million to fund the training of the social care workforce.</p>
                    <p>The creation of integrated care system (ICS’s) - integration within the NHS( between different NHS organisations) and integration between the NHS and local government - underpins this reform and is theorised to address the nuances in local health and social needs across the country. The White Paper suggests this would provide patients with more “personalised” and “accessible” care and enhance the ability of those providing  care services to do so in the areas of care they specialise in.</p>
                    <p>Addressing the plans, Boris Johnson said: “The pandemic highlighted what our fantastic NHS and local government can achieve when they work together - from delivering the phenomenal vaccine rollout to supporting those who were shielding”. And further mentioned “Our Integration White Paper is part of our wider plans to reform and recover the health and social care system,ensuring everyone gets the treatment and care they need,when and where they need it”</p>
                    <p>The care and support workforce are central to achieving the vision of hiqh quality care and as a result need the same standard of training for this to come into fruition. The investments are expected to make social care a rewarding career with vast opportunities to develop and progress.</p>
